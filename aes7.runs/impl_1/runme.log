INFO: [Place 46-3] During incremental compilation, routing data from the original checkpoint is applied during place_design. As a result, dangling route segments and route conflicts may appear in the post place_design implementation due to changes between the original and incremental netlists. These routes can be ignored as they will be subsequently resolved by route_design. This issue will be cleaned up automatically in place_design in a future software release.

Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.

Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
